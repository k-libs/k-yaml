This project is a work in progress YAML serialization and deserialization
library.

== Roadmap

=== v0.1.0

[%header, cols="3,6,1"]
|===
| Feature | Description | Complete

| Stream Encoding Detection
| The ability to detect the unicode encoding format for the source input stream.
| {icon-heavy-check}

| Any Unicode to UTF-8
| The ability to translate from arbitrary Unicode input encodings to UTF-8.
| {icon-heavy-check}

| UTF-8 Input Stream
| An input stream of UTF-8 encoded character bytes.
| {icon-heavy-check}

| Buffered Input Stream
| A UTF-8 encoded character stream with buffering
| {icon-heavy-check}

| Input Stream Tokenizer
| Tokenizer that produces a stream of tokens as they appear in the input byte
  stream.
| {icon-heavy-check}

| YAML Token Scanner
| Token scanner that produces a valid stream of tokens representing the contents
  of a YAML input stream.  The YAML Token Scanner differs from the Input Stream
  Tokenizer in that the token scanner emits all the necessary explicit or
  implicit tokens necessary to construct a clear picture of the YAML document,
  while the Input Stream Tokenizer simply produces a stream of the literal
  tokens that appear in the input stream without regard for correctness or
  implied necessary leading or trailing tokens.

| YAML Document Loader
| ??? Loads and returns full yaml documents
